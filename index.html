      <h2>Why is notetaking so important?</h2>
      <p>
        One of the big things that you should know about note taking is that it allows you to organize all the information in a manner that makes sense to you, as an individual. Not all people will take notes the same way, but that doesn't mean you should just haphazardly jot things down.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many different styles of notetaking that range from the linear to the artistic. The main ones you will find on this site are: the Outline Method, the Mapping Method, the Cornell Method, and the Sentence Method. Please feel free to also check out some <a href="samples.html">samples</a> of my notes, and try various methods out. With a little practice, you too can have clear, concise, logical notes that will help you not only study for a quiz or test, but all you to be a bit more organized in your professional life.

      <h2>The Outline Method</h2>
      <p>
        The outline method is extremely useful for most classes, except for ones like math and some sciences. It allows you to group information in a way where the data goes from most general to most specific. The relationship between items is seen clearly due to the use of indents. Use of Roman numerals, letters, and numbers is optional.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use the outline method you place the main topics to the left, and as points get more specific you indent to place them under the point it stems from. Once you get the hang of thinking critically about the data, it is a cinch to use in most situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        This method is pretty simple to follow if you have been provided lecture notes that outline the flow of content, or if using a textbook, or PowerPoint.
      </p>

      <h2>The Mapping Method</h2>
      <p>
        The mapping method is a way of taking notes that resonates with many visual learners. The mapping method helps you visually see the relationships between various pieces of data. You can easily color code points or move them about (white-out tape definitely comes in handy with this).
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to use the mapping method you simply jot down points and connect them with lines. It sounds pretty simple, right? And it is!
      </p>

      <h2>The Cornell Method</h2>
      <p>
        The Cornell method is touted as one of the "best" notetaking systems out there. I say that there is no "best"...only what is best for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Cornell method has you draw a line about 1/3 of the width of the notebook paper. On the left side you will fill in key words, and on the right side you will take down your notes as the lecture occurs. As the teacher moves on from topic to topic, leave a couple lines between each topic. Once the lecture is over, you go back over your notes, writing down the key words that relate to the information. At the end of your notes, create a summary area where you fill in your own summary of the information you were given.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reviewing your notes is pretty simple with this method. Simply fold over, or cover the right side of your notes, read your key word(s), then say all the points that would follow on the right side. Uncover the right side and double check yourself.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>The Sentence Method</h2>
      <p>
        The sentence method is probably the method you grew up using. It entails simply writing down full and complete sentences (and including a reference to the source). Many people recommend using numbers to create a list of sentences, others may choose to use dashes, dots, or just leave a blank line between each sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        The downfall with this method is that it is difficult to organize the data and it is hard to see the relation between topics. It is also hard to see what the main points are.

      <p>
        If you are interested in seeing what else is being said about various notetaking systems, you can check this <a href="http://www.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/studyskills/essentials/note-taking/different_models.html"> site</a>. I find that while this site provides lots of information, the way it is structured makes it hard to compare the various styles. I also feel like this site might benefit from images that show the different styles since it delves pretty far into detail about the "how" of the different methods. I do like the use of a different color for the headings since it breaks up the content in a way that makes it easier to find what you're looking for. I also found that some of the links on the page were broken, so it would seem that they need to maintain their page a little bit better.
